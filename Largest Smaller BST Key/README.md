# Problem:

Given a root of a Binary Search Tree (BST) and a number `num`, implement an efficient function `findLargestSmallerKey` that finds the largest key in the tree that is smaller than `num`. If such a number doesnâ€™t exist, return -1. Assume that all keys in the tree are nonnegative.

# Example:

For `num = 17` and the binary search tree below:
