## Description:

Given a 2D array *binaryMatrix* of *0s* and *1s*, implement a function *getNumberOfIslands* that returns the number of islands of *1s* in *binaryMatrix*. 

An island is defined as a group of adjacent values that are all *1s*. A cell in *binaryMatrix* is considered adjacent to another cell if they are next to each either on the same row or column. Note that two values of *1* are *not* part of the same island if they’re sharing only a mutual “corner” (i.e. they are diagonally neighbors). 

## Example:
