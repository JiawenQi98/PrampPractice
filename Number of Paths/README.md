# Problem:

You’re testing a new driverless car that is located at the Southwest (bottom-left) corner of an *n×n* grid. The car is supposed to get to the opposite, Northeast (top-right), corner of the grid. Given *n*, the size of the grid’s axes, write a function *numOfPathsToDest* that returns the number of the possible paths the driverless car can take.
